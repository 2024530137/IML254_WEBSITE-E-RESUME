<h1>My Reflection</h1>

<p>
Throughout the process of completing this IML254 individual assignment, I have learned many new things about creating a basic website. Before this, I only knew simple HTML tags, but through this project,<br>I became more confident in using different elements such as images, tables, links, and simple formatting. Even though the website looks simple, every part of the coding helped me understand how a real webpage<br>is built.</br>
</p>

<p>
One of the biggest things I learned is how to structure a website properly. I needed to make sure all the pages are linked together, the images are placed in the correct folder, and the navigation menu works on every<br>page. At first it felt confusing, especially when some images did not appear or when the links did not work. However, after trying a few times, I realised that website development requires patience, attention to detail,<br>and careful file management.</br>
</p>

<p>
I also learned how to use external links such as Google Maps and official websites. This showed me how webpages on the internet are connected to each other. Besides that, I gained experience writing content<br>about myself, my education, my involvement as a student, and my experience in a simple and structured way. These skills will definitely help me in the future, especially when preparing an online resume or portfolio.</br>
</p>

<p>
Overall, this assignment has given me confidence to create more websites in the future. I may still be a beginner, but I feel proud that I managed to complete a full website from scratch using simple HTML. This<br>project has taught me to be more independent, explore new tools, and not give up when facing difficulties. I hope I can continue improving my skills and learn more about web development in the next semester.
